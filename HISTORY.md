# FireOps7 — Build History & DB Reference

## What's Built & Working ✅
- Full auth flow + middleware routing
- Unified main nav — identical for all roles: Dashboard / Personnel / Training & Events / Operations / Inspections / Reports
- My Profile link in sidebar footer (name links to own personnel profile)
- Dept Admin hub: Equipment (`/dept-admin/setup`) / Personnel (`/dept-admin/personnel`) / Training (`/dept-admin/training`) / Hose Inventory / Hydrants / ISO Report
- Equipment hub — 5 tabs: Stations, Apparatus (with Load button), Compartments, Items, Assets
- Personnel hub — 2 tabs: Members (card grid), Attendance Settings
- Training hub — 4 tabs: Cert Types, Enrollments, Pending, Events (left rail + mobile scroll)
- Sys admin dashboard, Departments, Users, System Logs
- Sys admin dept drill-in `/admin/dept/[id]` — 5 tabs
- Personnel roster + profile (role-based editing, change password, officer add)

- Training/Certifications — courses, enrollments, verification, direct cert entry, training events, digital signatures
- Incidents — manual entry, apparatus/personnel tracking, mutual aid, officer verify + finalize
- ISO audit — hose inventory (add/edit/remove/log test), hydrant flow tests (add/edit/remove/log test), apparatus specs, mutual aid log, `/iso/report`
- Reports — inspections, inventory, training, attendance, my-activity (all with print)
- Member training record print

- Vercel deployed + fireops7.com DNS live

## What's Not Yet Built
- Immediate next build: inventory / equipment storage system. Build the unassigned item pool, member add-from-storage, move logging, and restore the quantity guard in `removeItemFromCompartment` (`app/actions/equipment.ts`) so quantity items move to storage instead of disappearing.
- NERIS compliance/API integration is intentionally blocked until FSRI/vendor permission and credentials are granted.
- Officer sub-menu — elevated access for officers (not yet designed)
- Permit approval email direct to resident (blocked until fireops7.com verified in Resend, ~1 month)
- Inspection schedule settings (daily/weekly/monthly per dept)
- Subdomain routing `slug.fireops7.com` (blocked until Vercel Pro)
- Officer personnel inline edit on roster cards
- Public site Option B — API keys (on demand only)
- CAD email parsing for incidents
- Mutual aid partners manual entry table

## UI/UX Cleanup Backlog
Items flagged during development — address during next cleanup pass:
- `/dept-admin/items` page is duplicated by `/dept-admin/setup` (ItemsStep.tsx). Nav points to setup; `/dept-admin/items` only reachable via asset roster deep link and direct URL. Options: delete `/dept-admin/items` and update the asset roster link, or extract a shared component. Low urgency — admin-only, off-nav.
- `/equipment/page.tsx` (hub index) is an orphan — equipment is now accessed via Inspections apparatus cards. Can be removed; update the asset roster link (`/dept-admin/items?tab=assets`) to point elsewhere.

## Session History

### 2026-05-06 — Admin Hub + Unified Nav + ISO
- Equipment hub (`/dept-admin/setup`): wizard → plain tabs (Stations/Apparatus/Compartments/Items/Assets), Personnel tab removed
- Load button on each apparatus card → `/equipment/[id]?from=/dept-admin/setup`; back nav returns to hub
- Back button moved below header as styled action row button across ALL detail pages (equipment, stations, incidents, personnel, inspection run, new incident, new event)
- Personnel hub (`/dept-admin/personnel`): Members tab (card grid 1→2→3 cols) + Attendance Settings tab
- Training hub: updated to left rail + mobile scroll tabs, renamed "Training"
- Main nav unified — identical for all roles: Dashboard/Personnel/Training & Events/Operations/Inspections/Reports
- ISO removed from main nav; added to Dept Admin: Hose Inventory / Hydrants / ISO Report (3 separate links)
- Assets tab added to Equipment hub (5th tab): card grid using existing props + "Full Roster →" link
- `removeHose` + `removeHydrant` server actions added to `iso.ts`
- Hose/Hydrant pages: Add button moved below header, Remove button added per row (inline confirm/cancel)

### 2026-05-06 — Nav Redesign + Member Equipment + Back Navigation
- Nav restructured: Personnel / Training & Events / Operations / Inspections / ISO (officer+) / Reports

- `BackButton` component (`components/BackButton.tsx`) — accepts `href` for explicit dest or falls back to `router.back()`
