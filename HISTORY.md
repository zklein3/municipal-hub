# FireOps7 — Build History & DB Reference

## What's Built & Working ✅
- Multi-department support — users with multiple active `department_personnel` rows select context at login (`/select-department`) and can switch via sidebar. `department_type` (fire/law_enforcement/public_works/municipal) drives nav gating + navy theme for non-fire depts. All pages/actions resolve the *selected* department via `lib/current-department.ts`, not just the first row — see `CLAUDE.md` "IMMEDIATE NEXT" for the 2026-06-26 session that fixed ~90 files relying on the old unscoped pattern.
- Full auth flow + middleware routing
- Hub-and-spoke navigation — sidebar 6 items only (Dashboard, Operations, Personnel, Training, Inventory, Reports). Each leads to a card-grid hub page. Dept Admin is a single link → hub with tiles.
- `HubCard` component — reusable card with title, description, stat badge, alert state
- `PageNavBar` — global Back + hub breadcrumb on every dashboard page (pathname-driven, no per-page wiring)
- Operations hub (`/operations`) — Incidents, Announcements, Fuel Log, Public Inbox cards + recent incidents list
- Inventory page (`/equipment`) — member-focused. Station Storage card at top + apparatus list grouped by station. Each apparatus card: Vehicle Check | Inspect (vehicle check → auto-advance to compartment inventory via `?next=inventory`) | View Inventory | Fuel Log. No admin hub cards for members.
- Member movement permissions — all members can move items to/from storage and compartment-to-compartment. Officer gate removed from `moveQuantityToStorage` / `moveQuantityFromStorage`. Audit trail (item_movement_log) provides accountability. Only item creation remains officer/admin gated.
- Asset Roster (`/reports/assets` via `/equipment/assets`) — moved to Reports hub as read-only officer/admin audit view. Apparatus assignment now lives in Equipment Setup → Items → Assets tab.
- Compartment display — `[unit_number] - [code]` (e.g. `24 - D1`) everywhere a compartment appears in apparatus context (inventory detail, inspection pages, move dropdowns). Setup screen stays universal (code only).
- Reports hub (`/reports`) — tile grid, role-adaptive (members see My Activity only, officers+ see all)
- Dept Admin hub (`/dept-admin`) — Personnel, **Events**, Training, Equipment Setup, Inspections, ISO (conditional), NERIS (conditional), Public Site (conditional)
- ISO sub-hub (`/iso`) — Hose Inventory, Hydrants, Mutual Aid, Pre-Fire Plans, ISO Report
- Training hub card row — Events, My Certifications (expiry alert), Print Training Card
- My Profile link in sidebar footer (name links to own personnel profile)
- Equipment Setup (Dept Admin) — 4 tabs: Stations, Apparatus, Compartments, Items. Items tab has 3 sub-tabs: Items → Asset Categories (with inspection templates nested per item) → Assets (with inline apparatus assignment). Compartments tab has Active/All toggle (defaults Active). Assets tab removed from outer shell — lives inside Items.
- Personnel hub — 2 tabs: Members (card grid), Attendance Settings
- Training hub — 4 tabs: Cert Types, Enrollments, Pending, Events (left rail + mobile scroll)
- Sys admin dashboard, Departments, Users, System Logs, NERIS panel
- Sys admin dept drill-in `/admin/dept/[id]` — 5 tabs
- Personnel roster + profile (role-based editing, change password, officer add)
- Apparatus list + detail (edit, compartment assign/remove, Manage Equipment link)
- Stations list + detail
- Equipment management — `/equipment/[id]` assign/remove/move items; Back button below header
- Compartment detail — items with Move + Remove for ALL roles, Back button action row, Print QR
- Asset Roster — `/equipment/assets` dept-wide with status filters, inline apparatus assignment
- Inspection template builder (inline via Dept Setup)
- Inspection run — presence checks + full asset checklist, all step types
- Inspection sessions — claim/release, 12h expiry, expired-session email notifications
- Inspections landing page — grouped by station → apparatus cards → compartments with View / Inspect / Daily Check / Vehicle Check
- Daily Check mode (presence-only)
- Vehicle Check system (`/inspections/vehicle-check/[id]`) — standalone truck check separate from compartment inspection. Dept-configurable checklist (24 items, 7 groups: Fluids, Mechanical, Lights, Communications, Emergency Equipment, Cleaning, Air Brakes). Per-apparatus toggles: `has_air_brakes` (shows Air Brakes group), `has_engine_hours` (shows engine hours field). Instructions on every item (procedure, what to look for, pass/fail) — shown expanded by default, toggle to hide. Odometer + engine hours fields. Progress bar, issue count, history panel (last 10 checks). On submit → `/inspections?checked=[id]`. "Do inventory on this vehicle?" link → compartment session
- Vehicle check items admin — Dept Admin → Inspections → Vehicle Check Items tab. Add/edit/disable per item, instructions textarea, reset to defaults. Items are dept-owned and seeded from code defaults on first use
- Apparatus detail page — ISO Specifications + Pump Tests section now appears before Compartments. Admin toggles for `has_air_brakes` and `has_engine_hours` in admin settings section
- Equipment Setup → Apparatus — collapsed to single Edit button (links to `/apparatus/[id]`); removed redundant Load and ISO Specs buttons
- QR system — human-readable codes, `/scan` redirect, print labels
- Announcements — pinning, unread tracking, dashboard banner
- Events + attendance — full lifecycle, excused absence, close event, auto-close cron. `/events` is member-only clean view; `/dept-admin/events` is officer management (bulk log, pending queue, edit, cancel, delete, close). Events have a Training toggle (hours + cert type) that auto-creates linked `training_events` rows and auto-issues certs on attendance verification.
- Training/Certifications — courses, enrollments, verification, direct cert entry, training events, digital signatures. Training-linked events show on `/training` page with "via [Event Title]" badge. Standalone training events have Cancel button.
- Incidents — manual entry, apparatus/personnel tracking, mutual aid, officer verify + finalize
- Incident run signatures — NERIS submit triggers signature rows for all responders; members sign via Inbox; officer sees signed/pending roster on incident detail page
- ISO audit — hose inventory (add/edit/remove/log test), hydrant flow tests (add/edit/remove/log test), apparatus specs (pump, tank, foam, aerial, turning radius, GVWR), mutual aid log, `/iso/report`
- Reports — inspections, inventory, training, attendance, my-activity (all with print)
- Member training record print
- Run Sheet print page (`/print/run-sheet?id=xxx`) — matches paper Run Field Report: apparatus groups with member names, POV group, Station group (standby), mutual aid To/From, full dept roster with checkmarks, fits on one letter sheet
- Run Sheet — role labels (IC, Driver, Officer, FF) right of name; cert labels below name; members sorted by role order within each apparatus group; cert display driven by `show_on_run_report` flag on cert types; address includes zip; incident info labels tab-aligned; incident time + type of incident columns span full width; type checkboxes right-aligned; single "Incident Role" column header at top of Units Dispatched
- Run Report page (`/reports/run-report`) — filterable by date range + incident type; incident list with type badge, address, unit/responder counts; Print button per row opens run sheet
- Training Admin — Member Certs tab: officers read-only, admins can edit cert records (dates, cert number, issuing body, active); direct cert entry form stacked for all screen sizes
- `certification_types.show_on_run_report` boolean — dept admin toggles per cert type whether it appears on run sheets (EMT yes, CPR no); set in Cert Types create/edit form
- Public department sites — `/dept/[slug]/*`, per-dept on/off toggle
- Burn permit system — public form, inbox sign-then-approve flow, officer + applicant signatures, printable Nebraska state permit
- Burn permit submission notification → logEvent → sys admin email
- Records request system — public form, inbox review flow
- Public Inbox — burn permits + records tabs, pending count badge; all members see Signatures tab
- Login show/hide password toggle
- BackButton component — `href` prop for explicit dest, else `router.back()`; always below header in action row
- Fire School — QR scanning, bottle tracking, fill log, realtime fill log, fill verification, timezone settings, on/off marketing toggle
- Training — unified member training page, direct cert entry, dept-wide enrollment, cert signatures, auto-cert issuance from events
- Medical supply lot editing — officer+ can edit `lot_number` and `expiration_date` on any active lot after receipt (Edit button per lot in expanded view).
- Medical batch waste expired — "Waste Expired" button at supply level wastes all expired active lots in one operation (reason + signatures collected once). Server action: `wasteExpiredLots`.
- Medical bidirectional flow — MedicalBagsSection + MedicalCompartmentsSection both have Restock (pull from storeroom) and Transfer (push to storeroom). Unified terminology across all surfaces.
- Medical reports location labels — `/reports/medical` expiring/expired section and stock vs PAR both show location type badge (Storeroom gray / Bag purple / Compartment blue) + apparatus unit number context for bags/compartments. Expired rows red-tinted; expired count badge in section header.
- Inbox Restock tab — now shows expired lots with remaining stock as a red "Expired Stock" section at top, with "Go to →" link that routes to `/equipment/[id]` for bag lots or `/medical` for storeroom lots. Restock Requests section below. Tab badge turns red when expired lots present. Data fetched in `inbox/page.tsx` alongside reorder requests.
- Outside training submissions — member-initiated log for external classes/conferences. Photo upload → Claude Haiku AI parse pre-fills fields. Purpose + NREMT category dropdowns (AIRWAY/CARDIOLOGY/TRAUMA/MEDICAL/OPERATIONS). Officer/admin reviews via Submissions tab in Training Admin; approval optionally links to cert type and auto-issues cert record. All submissions visible on member `/training` page with status + reviewer notes.
- NERIS Special Incident Modifiers section added to `NERIS.md` — FIFA World Cup 2026 modifier documented with when-to-apply guidance
- Security: enabled RLS on `qr_debug_scans` (was fully open — resolved Supabase critical alert)
- Storage bucket `training-docs` created for outside training document photos
- Error logging + email via notify-on-log Edge Function
- Vercel deployed + fireops7.com DNS live
- PD Contact Log (`/forms/contact`, Yutan PD pilot) — people-first form: People Involved block (name/DOB/phone/standard Address-City-State-Zip) up top, separate "Called To Address" (also standard Address/City/State/Zip), dept-configurable Contact Type and multi-select Action Taken lists (`/dept-admin/police`, lazy-seeded with sensible defaults, reorder/rename/deactivate, usage-aware delete), per-department Case Numbering (manual free text or auto `PREFIX-YY-0001` via atomic Postgres counter, with an admin "set starting number" override), single Narrative field, officer-safety flag on persons (`is_dangerous`/`danger_reason`) that surfaces anywhere that person appears, shared read-only Person Card modal, inline edit of DOB/phone/address on existing People Involved chips with write-back to the source `pd_persons`/`pd_addresses` row.
- PD Business Check Log (`/forms/business-check`, Yutan PD pilot) — officers select businesses from a managed list to log a routine round (start time required, end time auto-stamped on submit); per-business detail sheet (doors/windows/lights secure, alarm status, interior check + findings, owner notified, disposition) can be opened inline before submitting the whole round as one batch.

## What's Not Yet Built
- Immediate next build: inventory / equipment storage system. Build the unassigned item pool, member add-from-storage, move logging, and restore the quantity guard in `removeItemFromCompartment` (`app/actions/equipment.ts`) so quantity items move to storage instead of disappearing.
- NERIS compliance/API integration is intentionally blocked until FSRI/vendor permission and credentials are granted.
- Officer sub-menu — elevated access for officers (not yet designed)
- Permit approval email direct to resident (blocked until fireops7.com verified in Resend, ~1 month)
- Inspection schedule settings (daily/weekly/monthly per dept)
- Subdomain routing `slug.fireops7.com` (blocked until Vercel Pro)
- Officer personnel inline edit on roster cards
- Public site Option B — API keys (on demand only)
- CAD email parsing for incidents
- Mutual aid partners manual entry table
- Native print bridge for Android app wrapper — Print button currently hands off to the system browser (Chrome) via `@capacitor/browser` since Android's WebView doesn't implement `window.print()`. Works fine but adds an extra hop (leaves the app, prints from Chrome). Before the official Play Store / App Store release, build a real native print bridge (WebView `createPrintDocumentAdapter()` + Android `PrintManager`, exposed to JS via a custom plugin/JS interface) so printing happens without leaving the app. Today's fix is durable, not a throwaway hack — just not the most seamless version.

## UI/UX Cleanup Backlog
Items flagged during development — address during next cleanup pass:
- `/dept-admin/items` page is duplicated by `/dept-admin/setup` (ItemsStep.tsx). Nav points to setup; `/dept-admin/items` only reachable via asset roster deep link and direct URL. Options: delete `/dept-admin/items` and update the asset roster link, or extract a shared component. Low urgency — admin-only, off-nav.
- `/equipment/page.tsx` (hub index) is an orphan — equipment is now accessed via Inspections apparatus cards. Can be removed; update the asset roster link (`/dept-admin/items?tab=assets`) to point elsewhere.

## Session History

### 2026-06-29 — PD Contact Log: Standard Address Fields + Mobile Case Number Fix (+ backfilled PD module history)

**Tonight's changes** (`app/actions/pd-contacts.ts`, `app/(dashboard)/forms/contact/page.tsx`, `ContactClient.tsx`):
- People Involved address (`pd_persons`) and Called To Address (`pd_addresses`/`pd_contacts`) both reworked from a single freeform address line into standard contact-card layout: separate Address / City / State / Zip entry boxes, matching layout in both places (City flex-1, State w-20 maxLength=2, Zip w-24). New `fullAddress()` helper composes the four fields back into one display line everywhere an address is shown (person card, chip summary, history list, detail modal, called-to autocomplete results).
- Both `pd_persons` and `pd_addresses` gained `city`/`state`/`zip` text columns (`pd_contacts` too, to snapshot the called-to address at time of contact). When an officer selects an *existing* person or address and fills in previously-missing city/state/zip on the form, those corrections write back to the source row (conditional partial UPDATE — only touches fields with a submitted value, never blanks out existing good data). Mirrors the existing `resolvePersons()` write-back pattern.
- Mobile layout bug: Case Number was the third item in a 3-column flex row with Date/Time and got clipped on small screens. Moved to its own full-width row below Date/Time.

**Backfilled — the PD Contact Log / Business Check Log module had no prior Session History entries despite being built across several earlier sessions this week for the Yutan PD pilot (Terry, fire dept member + Yutan police chief). Consolidated summary of that arc:**
- `409df66` — Business Check Log built from scratch: officers select businesses from a managed list, log a routine round (start required, end auto-stamped), per-business detail sheet, submit as one batch. New `pd_businesses`, `pd_business_checks`.
- `d8fe79c` — Contact Log built from scratch: normalized schema (`pd_addresses`, `pd_persons`, `pd_contacts`, `pd_contact_persons`) replacing an empty placeholder single-row table; multiple people per contact, address-based contact history, reverse name lookup, officer-safety flag (`is_dangerous`/`danger_reason`) surfaced wherever a person appears, shared Person Card modal, read-only contact detail view.
- `8b62b08` — Added `/dept-admin/police` settings area (Contact Types, Action Taken, Case Numbering tabs) backed by new lazy-seeded `pd_contact_types`/`pd_action_taken_types` tables and `pd_case_number_mode`/`prefix` on `departments`.
- `bf5619a` — Cut the form over to people-first layout per direct chief feedback: People Involved moved to the top of the form and applies to every contact type (not just traffic stops); old required `reason` field retired in favor of a single `narrative` field; Contact Type and Action Taken now read from the dept-configurable lists instead of hardcoded values.
- `7ff148a` — Renamed "Report Number" to "Case Number" throughout the UI to match how officers actually refer to it.
- `5d7c903` — Fixed a race condition where `pd_contact_types`/`pd_action_taken_types` lazy-seeding could insert duplicate default rows under concurrent first-load; added an admin "set starting case number" override (for departments that hand-numbered cases before turning on auto mode) and usage-aware delete (can't deactivate a type that's still referenced by historical contacts without an explicit override).
- `4ceeacc` — Made case number assignment opt-in per contact rather than auto-assigning on every save once a dept is in Auto mode (officers sometimes draft/save without wanting to burn a number yet); People Involved chips started showing DOB/phone inline instead of name-only.
- `b8e19c0` — Extended DOB/phone/address editing to *existing* People Involved chips (previously those fields only existed on the "Add New Person" path, so a selected existing person's stale info couldn't be corrected in-form).

### 2026-06-25 — Burn Permit Print Cleanup + Capacitor App Wrapper Fixes

**Print/county info cleanup:** County/sheriff contact info was a single freeform field (dept-admin side was even a single-line input), so multi-county entries had no reliable line break and ran together on print (Winslow's Dodge/Washington county numbers). Replaced with a structured `CountyContactsEditor` (name + phone rows, `lib/county-contacts.ts` parse/serialize) used in both the sys admin and dept-admin settings panels; print pages render each contact as its own row. Fixed live data for Winslow + Valley FD. Also rebalanced signature block emphasis on both print pages — names/phone numbers bold, field labels demoted to small uppercase captions (previously backwards).

**Inbox additions:** Permit cards now show expiration date directly (not just in expanded detail). Added a "Contact Holder" button (`PermitContactModal` + `contactPermitHolder` action) to email the permit holder directly — needed for the obligation to notify residents if burn conditions change after issuance. Reuses the existing Resend send path, logs to `system_logs` for an audit trail. Default message: "Your burn permit is cancelled until further notice."

**Capacitor app wrapper fixes (Android):**
- All "Print"/"Print My Permit" links used `target="_blank"`, which Capacitor's WebView can't open (no multi-window support) — silently did nothing on Android. Removed it from all four permit print links.
- Added an explicit "← Back" button (`PrintBackButton`) to both print pages since they have no header/nav of their own.
- Hardware Android back button exited the app entirely instead of navigating — `MainActivity.java` didn't override `onBackPressed()`. Fixed to call `webview.goBack()` when there's history. **Requires APK rebuild to take effect** (confirmed working after rebuild).
- `window.print()` is a no-op in Android's native WebView — no print dialog wired up regardless of code. Added `@capacitor/browser`; `PrintButton` now hands off to the system browser (Chrome) when running natively, where print-to-PDF actually works. Durable fix, not a placeholder — same pattern will carry into the eventual Play Store / App Store builds. See "What's Not Yet Built" for the native print bridge as a future polish item (skip the browser hop entirely).

### 2026-06-13 — Android/Capacitor: VS Code JDK/Gradle Setup ✅ RESOLVED

VS Code opened the `android/` Capacitor folder and showed a JDK-required warning (Java/Gradle extensions activated for the first time). Goal: get the Gradle sync to succeed in VS Code on the personal machine (`C:\Users\zklein3`).

**Fix:**
- No separate JDK download needed — Android Studio already bundles a JetBrains Runtime (JDK 21) at `C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr`
- Set `JAVA_HOME` (user env var) to that path
- Added `org.gradle.java.home=C:/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/jbr` to `android/gradle.properties` (committed — same default path on shared machine too)
- Initially still showed "JVM 8" error after a VS Code restart — env var / extension state just needed more time to fully propagate. After a longer wait it resolved on its own; Java/Gradle now report ready with no errors.
- (Earlier dead-end, no longer needed: Red Hat OpenJDK 8 was installed to `C:\Java\jdk-1.8.0_492` and briefly set as `JAVA_HOME` — superseded by the JBR 21 path above.)

### 2026-06-13 — Cleared Test Burn Permits from Production

Deleted 13 archived burn permit records from `burn_permits` (Winslow Fire Department) directly via SQL — all leftover test submissions from development (expired test permits for "Zachary Adam Klein", "Mike Rotch", "Anita Hanjaab", "Dale Jr.", "John Test", and one denied "Test" entry). Burn Permits → Archived tab is now empty.

### 2026-06-13 — Inbox Delete Buttons (Burn Permits + Feedback) + Record Requests Archive Filter

**`app/actions/public-site.ts`** — two new delete actions, both gated to officer/admin (`system_role !== 'member'`):
- `deleteBurnPermit(formData)` — requires `permit_id` + the acting user's current login `password`, re-verified via `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` (same pattern as `changeOwnPassword`) before the row is deleted from `burn_permits`. Burn permits are official records meant to persist, so deletion needs this extra confirmation.
- `deletePublicFeedback(formData)` — requires `feedback_id`, deletes from `public_feedback`. No password gate — feedback/problem reports are low-stakes cleanup.

**`BurnPermitsTab.tsx`** — expanded card now has a "Delete permit record" link at the bottom (any status). Click → red confirm panel with a password field + "Confirm Delete" / "Cancel". Wrong password surfaces "Incorrect password." from the server action.

**`FeedbackTab.tsx`** — expanded card now has a "Delete feedback" link at the bottom. Click → red confirm panel with "Confirm Delete" / "Cancel", no password required.

**`RecordRequestsTab.tsx`** — same Active/Archived filter pattern as the other two tabs (`active | pending | in_review | archived`, new `isArchivedRequest` = `fulfilled` or `denied`, new `FILTER_LABELS` map). No delete button — record requests just archive, per user preference to keep an audit trail of what was fulfilled/denied.

### 2026-06-13 — Inbox Active/Archived Filters for Burn Permits + Feedback

**`BurnPermitsTab.tsx`** — filter bar changed from `all | pending | approved | denied` to `active | pending | approved | archived`. New helpers `isExpiredPermit(p)` (approved + past `permit_expiry_date`) and `isArchivedPermit(p)` (denied, cancelled, or expired). Default view is "Active" — denied, cancelled, and expired permits drop out automatically without any DB changes; "Archived" tab shows them on demand.

**`FeedbackTab.tsx`** — same pattern: filter bar changed from `all | new | reviewed | resolved` to `active | new | reviewed | archived` via new `isArchivedFeedback(item)` (resolved items archive immediately). New `FILTER_LABELS` map covers the filter-only `active`/`archived` values (separate from the existing `STATUS_LABELS` used for item badges).

Both lists stay smaller by default; nothing is deleted or hidden permanently — just moved to the Archived tab.

### 2026-06-13 — Stop Sys Admin Alerts for Burn Permit / Feedback Submissions

Tested the 2026-06-09 department notification toggles (`burn_permit_reviewer`, `notify_feedback`) live — each submission was sending **two** emails to `zklein3@gmail.com`: one from the new per-department notification, and a duplicate from the sys-admin-only `notify-on-log` Edge Function (triggered by the `logEvent({ log_type: 'user_report' })` call in `submitBurnPermit`/`submitPublicFeedback`).

**`notify-on-log` Edge Function** (deployed v6) — now short-circuits for `log_type: 'user_report'` when `page` is `/dept/burn-permit` or `/dept/feedback`, since those are fully handled by the department-level email. Sys admin still gets alerted for `/dept/records` (records requests — no per-department toggle yet) and `/inbox` (record request status changes), plus all `error`, `fire_school_inquiry`, and `contact_request` log types as before.

**v7** — also short-circuits `log_type: 'error'` when `page` is `/login` (failed login attempts — wrong password, no personnel record). These are routine and too frequent to email individually; still recorded in `system_logs` for `/admin/logs` review. No account lockout mechanism exists yet — if one is built later, a dept-admin-facing notification can be added separately. Internal "Report a Problem" submissions (`submitUserReport` in `app/actions/personnel.ts`, any other page) are untouched and still alert sys admin.

### 2026-06-09 — Department Email Notification for New Burn Permit Applications

**`department_personnel.burn_permit_reviewer`** (existing column, previously unused) is now wired up — per-person opt-in toggle, settable by department admins.

**Personnel profile** (`/personnel/[id]`, admin-editable Department Information section) — new checkbox: "Email this person when a new burn permit is submitted for review" (only meaningful for Officers/Admins). `updateDeptPersonnel` (`app/actions/personnel.ts`) persists it.

**`submitBurnPermit`** (`app/actions/public-site.ts`) — after logging the submission, queries `department_personnel` for active officers/admins with `burn_permit_reviewer = true` in that department, looks up their `personnel.email`, and sends a notification email via Resend (`FireOps7 <noreply@fireops7.com>`) with applicant info, burn address/date/description, and a link to `/inbox`. Same pattern as the new public feedback notification below.

### 2026-06-09 — Department Email Notification for New Public Feedback

**`department_personnel`** gains `notify_feedback boolean default false`. Per-person opt-in toggle, settable by department admins (mirrors the unused `burn_permit_reviewer` pattern, but actually wired up).

**Personnel profile** (`/personnel/[id]`, admin-editable Department Information section) — new checkbox: "Email this person when new public feedback or problem reports are submitted" (only meaningful for Officers/Admins). `updateDeptPersonnel` (`app/actions/personnel.ts`) persists it.

**`submitPublicFeedback`** (`app/actions/public-site.ts`) — after logging the submission, queries `department_personnel` for active officers/admins with `notify_feedback = true` in that department, looks up their `personnel.email`, and sends a notification email via Resend (`FireOps7 <noreply@fireops7.com>`) with the submitter info, message, and a link to `/inbox`. Previously only the sys admin (`zklein3@gmail.com`) was notified via the `notify-on-log` Edge Function — departments now get their own notifications.

### 2026-06-09 — Reply to Public Feedback (Department + Sys Admin)

**`public_feedback`** gains `reply_message`, `replied_at`, `replied_by_personnel_id` (→ `personnel`).

**`replyToPublicFeedback`** (`app/actions/public-site.ts`) — officer+ in the feedback's department, or sys admin. Requires `contact_email` on the submission (no email = no reply path, surfaced in UI). Sends a reply via Resend (`noreply@fireops7.com`, `reply_to` = department's `public_email` if set) quoting the original message, signed with the department name (or "The FireOps7 Team" for sys admin). Records the reply + auto-marks the submission `resolved`.

**Reply UI:**
- `/inbox` Feedback tab (`FeedbackTab.tsx`) — Reply textarea + send button inside each expanded item; shows sent reply with timestamp/author.
- `/admin/logs` (`LogsClient.tsx`) — `user_report` log entries from feedback submissions now carry `metadata.feedback_id`; expanding the log shows the same reply UI, letting sys admin respond directly without needing department access.

### 2026-06-09 — Public Site Feedback / Bug Reports

**New `/dept/[slug]/feedback` page** — public form (General Feedback or Report a Problem), optional name/email, message + page URL captured automatically. Linked from dept site header nav (desktop + mobile) and a new "Feedback & Issues" card in the "How Can We Help?" grid.

**Department-scoped, dual-logged:**
- `public_feedback` table (new) — `department_id`, `feedback_type`, `contact_name/email`, `message`, `page_url`, `status` (new/reviewed/resolved), `reviewer_notes`. RLS: anon insert only.
- `submitPublicFeedback` (`app/actions/public-site.ts`) — inserts the row AND calls `logEvent({ log_type: 'user_report', department_id, ... })` for `system_logs` (sys admin visibility via `/admin/logs` → User Reports tab)
- New "Feedback" tab in `/inbox` (officer+) — `FeedbackTab.tsx`, filter by status, mark Reviewed/Resolved/Reopen with reviewer notes. Scoped via `.eq('department_id', department_id)` — one department's submissions are never visible to another.
- `updatePublicFeedbackStatus` action added alongside existing burn permit / record request status actions

### 2026-06-09 — Social Share Metadata, F7 App Icon, Inventory Transfers

**Social share / Open Graph:**
- `scripts/generate-og-image.js` — generates `public/og-image.png` (1200×630, F7 logo + "FireOps7" wordmark + tagline + feature strip)
- `app/layout.tsx` — added `openGraph`/`twitter` metadata + `metadataBase` (`https://www.fireops7.com`); applies as the default card for any FireOps7 link shared on Facebook/LinkedIn/etc.
- `app/(public-site)/dept/[slug]/page.tsx` — added `generateMetadata` so each department's public site link shows that department's name (`[Dept Name] | FireOps7`) and `public_tagline`/`public_about` as the share description (same shared og-image for now)

**F7 app icon:**
- Replaced default Capacitor placeholder icon with F7 red square (`#991b1b` bg, white "F7") at all PWA + Android densities (mdpi→xxxhdpi)
- `scripts/generate-icons.js` added for future regeneration; `ic_launcher_background.xml` updated to `#991b1b`

**Inventory — bidirectional transfers:**
- Compartment → any compartment, all users, partial quantity supported (`transferQuantityBetweenCompartments`); deactivates source location standard when qty reaches 0
- Station storage → station storage, multi-station depts (`transferQuantityBetweenStorage`); `department_item_storage` gains nullable `station_id` (partial unique indexes for the existing null/general pool vs. per-station rows); Storage page shows per-station breakdown + "Transfer to Station" button
- Existing `moveQuantityToStorage` / `moveQuantityFromStorage` / `setStoragePar` scoped to the null-station (general) pool for backward compatibility

### 2026-06-06 — Mobile UX Pass + Medical Transfer Fixes

**Mobile button layouts (all pages now use 2-col grid on mobile):**
- Inventory page (`/equipment`) apparatus cards: stack vertically, 4 buttons → 2×2 grid
- Storage page item cards (`/equipment/storage`): action buttons → 2-col grid
- Medical storeroom supply cards: stack vertically, buttons wrap below supply info
- Medical storeroom lot rows: restructured — lot info + qty on top, buttons in 2-col grid below
- Medical bags section in apparatus inventory: stack vertically, 2-col button grid

**Medical transfer fixes:**
- Transfer button was gated on `storerooms.length > 1` — now also shows when apparatus compartments exist
- `apparatusMap` was built from station-only storerooms (always empty for bags) — fixed to use `allDeptStorerooms` so transfer destination dropdown shows unit number + bag name (e.g. "Engine 11 — Trauma Box")
- DB constraint on `medical_stock_transactions.transaction_type` updated: old constraint allowed `transferred` + `expired_removed`; app was writing `transferred_out` / `transferred_in`. Constraint now matches app values: `received | dispensed | wasted | transferred_out | transferred_in | adjusted`

**Inbox expired lots:**
- "Waste →" replaced with "Go to →" — routes to `/equipment/[id]` for apparatus bag lots, `/medical` for storeroom lots. Member works the expired stock from the correct location context.

**Medical bags — Receive button removed:**
- Receiving stock is a storeroom-only action. Removed Receive button from MedicalBagsSection. Bag inventory correctly shows: Lots | Restock | Transfer | Use only.

**PWA install:**
- `PWAInstallButton` component added to sidebar (desktop + mobile). Catches `beforeinstallprompt` event and shows "Install App" button when Chrome signals the site is installable. Invisible until Chrome is ready. Fixes the gray-monogram home screen icon problem.
- Manifest `start_url` changed from `/dashboard` → `/` (dashboard redirects unauthenticated users, which can block Chrome installability checks)

### 2026-06-04 — Medical Bag System + UX Fixes

**Bag template system:**
- `medical_bag_templates` + `medical_bag_template_items` tables — define standard loadouts (Trauma Box, ALS Bag, etc.)
- `medical_storerooms` gains `template_id` + `inventory_mode` (standard/independent)
- **Dept Admin → Medical → Bags tab** — create bag types, define supply inventory with PAR, assign to multiple apparatus inline. Deployment creates `medical_storerooms` record with inventory copied from template.
- `MedicalBagsSection.tsx` — reusable component: Use/Receive/Restock modals, lot display, mode toggle (Standard ↕ / Independent ↕), admin "Manage in Medical →" link
- Bags appear in **View Inventory** (`/equipment/[id]`) alongside compartments — unified inventory view
- Storerooms (station-based, no apparatus) shown on `/medical` member page; bags filtered out

**Permission model finalized:**
- Transfer non-controlled: all members | Transfer controlled: officer+ only (checked in `transferStock` action)
- Dispense/use: all members | Receive/waste/transfer: officer+ | Adjust: admin

**UX fixes:**
- Supply type create form: storeroom assignment inline (checkbox + PAR per storeroom)
- Storeroom admin form: apparatus dropdown removed (bags managed from Bags tab only)
- `isAdmin`/`isOfficerOrAbove` were hardcoded `false` on equipment detail page — fixed
- Trauma Box storeroom (test record) deleted from DB

### 2026-06-04 — Medical Supply Phase 3 + Phase 4 + Infrastructure

**Medical Phase 3:**
- `apparatus_id` (nullable FK) added to `medical_storerooms`; admin storeroom form adds "Apparatus (bag)" dropdown
- `/medical` shows apparatus unit+type as sub-label for apparatus-linked storerooms
- Apparatus detail page: Medical Bag card (supply count, alert count, "View Storeroom →") appears when storeroom linked
- `/print/medical-cs-log` — printable controlled substance transaction log, filterable by date/storeroom/supply; "Print CS Log ↗" button in History tab
- `/reports/medical` — Medical Supplies report: stock vs PAR table (sorted worst-first), consumption summary (7/30/60/90d toggle), expiring lots within 60 days; Medical Supplies card added to Reports hub (gated on `module_medical`)

**Medical Phase 4:**
- `adjustStock` action + "Adjust" button (admin-only, per lot) — sets absolute quantity, records `adjusted` transaction with reason + delta note
- `medical-stock-alerts` edge function deployed — daily cron 6 AM UTC; checks all depts for expired/expiring/below-PAR lots; sends one email per dept per day (deduped via `system_logs`); skips if no issues
- `module_medical` boolean added to `departments` (existing depts with storerooms auto-set `true`); gated on `/medical`, `/dept-admin/medical`, `/reports/medical`; toggle in sys admin Modules tab (Bundle D)
- `medical_reorder_requests` table — pending/fulfilled/dismissed; "Request Restock" button on low/empty inventory cards (deduped); Restock tab in Inbox for officers+ (only shown when `module_medical = true`)

**Infrastructure (2026-06-04):**
- PWA: `public/manifest.json` + `public/sw.js` + root layout meta tags; SVG icon; SW registration script
- Weekly backup: `.github/workflows/weekly-backup.yml` — Sunday 2 AM UTC, pg_dump → gzip → Backblaze B2, 12-week retention
- Capacitor: `capacitor.config.ts` + `@capacitor/core` installed (skeleton only — awaiting Winslow funding for store submission)

### 2026-06-16 — Weekly Backup Debugging Session
Fixed 4 issues in `.github/workflows/weekly-backup.yml` to get backup mostly working:
1. **Supabase direct host IPv6-only** — switched from `db.kolrhnxozeroaselapzn.supabase.co` to session pooler (IPv4-compatible). Confirmed correct shard via probing: `aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432`, username `postgres.kolrhnxozeroaselapzn`
2. **pg_dump version mismatch** — server is Postgres 17.6; default `postgresql-client` on ubuntu-latest installs v16. Added PGDG apt repo + install `postgresql-client-17` specifically
3. **Missing secrets** — set all 4 in GitHub repo secrets: `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`, `B2_KEY_ID`, `B2_APPLICATION_KEY`, `B2_BUCKET_NAME` (`fireops7-backups`)
4. **Added `set -euo pipefail`** to pg_dump step so future connection failures surface immediately instead of silently producing empty backups
- **pg_dump now works** — 412 KiB dump confirmed on run #6
- **⚠️ Still failing:** `B2_KEY_ID` secret likely has Bucket ID instead of Application Key ID → `InvalidAccessKeyId` on upload. Fix: Backblaze → App Keys → copy keyID column → update GitHub secret → re-run manually to confirm

### 2026-06-04 — Infrastructure & Business Strategy Discussion

**Decisions locked:**
- Vercel + Supabase free tier is appropriate until first paying department or NERIS goes live
- Upgrade trigger: Vercel Pro ($20) + Supabase Pro ($25) = ~$50/month total
- Long-term DB path: Supabase → Neon → AWS RDS PostgreSQL (migration = connection string change)
- Independent backup strategy: weekly pg_dump → Backblaze B2 (~$6/TB/month)
- Native app via Capacitor (wraps existing Next.js) — after Winslow operational + funded; ~2–3 weeks, $99/yr Apple + $25 Google Play

**PWA decision:** Add manifest.json + service worker as a fast win — members get home screen icon and full-screen launch today, no app store needed. Push notifications are a separate phase.

**Build roadmap agreed:**
1. PWA support (manifest + service worker)
2. Upgrade paid tiers (ops decision, no build)
3. Automated weekly backup edge function → Backblaze B2
4. Capacitor native app wrapper (after Winslow funded)

### 2026-06-04 — Medical Supply Phase 1 + Phase 2

**Phase 1 (Steps 1–5):**
- DB: `medical_supply_types`, `medical_storerooms`, `medical_storeroom_inventory`, `medical_stock_lots`, `medical_stock_transactions`
- Dept Admin → Medical (`/dept-admin/medical`) — 2 tabs: Supply Types (create/edit, controlled flag, expiration flag, required signatures, categories) + Storerooms (create/edit, station link, assign supply types with PAR levels)
- Member page (`/medical`) — storeroom selector, inventory cards with status badges (Good/Low/Expiring/Expired/Empty), lot detail expand, Receive Stock flow (lot number, expiration date, quantity, dual-sig for controlled), alerts panel (expired lots, expiring lots, below PAR)
- Inbox badge includes medical alert count; Dept Admin hub card added

**Phase 2 (Steps 1–4):**
- **Dispense/Use** — `dispenseStock` action; "Use" button on inventory card; modal with FIFO lot selector, quantity, notes, dual-sig for controlled; lot `quantity_remaining` decremented, auto-deactivates at 0; `dispensed` transaction written
- **Waste** — `wasteStock` action; "Waste" button per lot in expanded view; reason dropdown (Expired/Damaged/Contaminated/Recalled/Other), quantity with max cap, dual-sig for controlled; `wasted` transaction written
- **Transfer** — `transferStock` action; "Transfer" button per lot (hidden when only 1 storeroom); destination must have supply type assigned; deducts source lot, creates new lot in destination preserving lot/expiration data; `transferred_out` + `transferred_in` transaction pair
- **Transaction History** — Inventory|History tab toggle on `/medical`; last 90 days / 200 records; filters: storeroom, supply type, transaction type; each row: color-coded type badge, supply name, ±qty, lot#, performed by, signers, notes; flat fetch + JS join for names/lot numbers

### 2026-05-23 — Incident Signatures + Run Sheet Print

**Incident run signature system:**
- `incident_signatures` table — unique on `(incident_id, personnel_id)`. `signed_at` null = pending, timestamp = signed. `signature_data` stores base64 PNG.
- Trigger: after successful NERIS submit, signature rows upserted for all non-absent `incident_personnel` (`app/actions/neris.ts`)
- `app/actions/signatures.ts` — 4 actions: `getPendingSignatureCount`, `getPendingSignatures`, `saveIncidentSignature`, `getIncidentSignatureRoster`
- Inbox (`/inbox`) opened to all members (was officer-only redirect). New **Signatures** tab always first; Permits + Records tabs only visible to officers+. Members can sign from inbox via `IncidentSignaturePadModal`.
- Layout badge (`opsBadge`) includes pending signature count for all members
- Incident detail page — Run Signatures section (officer/admin): shows signed/pending roster, signed count
- `standby` added to `incident_personnel_role_check` DB constraint

**Run Sheet print page (`/print/run-sheet?id=xxx`):**
- Matches dept paper Run Field Report (one letter sheet, portrait)
- Top-left: Date, Address, Incident #, CAD # — Top-right: military times (Paged / Enroute / On Scene / Finished at Scene / Back at Station)
- Middle-left: Units Dispatched — each apparatus with member names listed; **POV** group for non-standby no-apparatus personnel; **Station** group for role=standby no-apparatus personnel
- Middle-right: Type of Incident checkboxes + Mutual Aid (To/From with dept name) + Cause / Dollar Loss / Property Lost / Vehicle Make / NERIS Done fields
- Narrative block if present
- Bottom: full dept roster in 3-column grid, checkmark for each responder
- Mutual aid reads from `incident_mutual_aid` table: `gave_aid` → To, `received_aid` → From; falls back to `incidents.mutual_aid_direction/department`
- Spacing tuned to fit on one sheet: `@page margin: 0.35in`, div padding `0.35in 0.5in`
- PrintButton hardened: `type="button"`, z-index 9999, shadow, "Print / Save PDF"
- "Print Run Sheet" button on incident detail page → opens `/print/run-sheet?id=...` in new tab

### 2026-05-22 — NERIS Rescue Module + Payload Validation
- **Rescue module rebuilt** — `NERIS_RESCUE_TYPE` removed (codes didn't exist in spec); replaced with correct spec-sourced enums:
  - `NERIS_PERSON_TYPE` (FF | NONFF), `NERIS_RESCUE_PERFORMED_BY` (6 rescue outcome codes), `NERIS_RESCUE_MODE` (EXTRICATION etc.), `NERIS_RESCUE_ACTIONS` (TypeRescueActionValue), `NERIS_RESCUE_IMPEDIMENTS`, `NERIS_PRESENCE_KNOWN`
  - `NERIS_CASUALTY_TYPE` codes fixed: INJURED_NONFATAL / INJURED_FATAL (not NONFATALLY / FATALLY)
- **Medical module field names confirmed** from spec — `patient_care_evaluation`, `patient_status`, `transport_disposition`; top-level key is `medical_details` (was wrong `medical_patients`)
- **`NERIS_MEDICAL_DISPOSITION` rebuilt** from `TypeMedicalTransportValue` — TRANSPORT_BY_EMS_UNIT | OTHER_AGENCY_TRANSPORT | NONPATIENT_TRANSPORT | PATIENT_REFUSED_TRANSPORT | NO_TRANSPORT
- **Hazmat key fixed** — `hazsit_detail` (was `hazardous_situation`); inner field names still TODO(api-review)
- **Payload builder** (`buildNerisPayload`) — built actual `CasualtyRescuePayload` with correct discriminated union nesting; built `medical_details` and `hazsit_detail` (were all TODO)
- **`presence_known` bug fixed** — was gated on `!isFfRescue`; corrected to `person_type === 'NONFF'` (a NONFF rescued by a FF still needs presence_known)
- **Outside fire form fixed** — condition on arrival, building damage, floor/room of origin now hidden for outside/wildland fires (were shown for all non-transportation fires)
- **Requirements checker fixed** — `fire_condition_arrival`, building damage, floor/room now structure-fire-only; `OUTSIDE_FIRE_CODES` / `STRUCTURE_FIRE_CODES` matching fixed to split pipe-delimited codes by `||` segment
- **Ventilation timing variants added** — 12 new action codes (PRIOR_TO_SUPPRESSION / DURING_SUPPRESSION / POST_SUPPRESSION for all 4 ventilation types)
- **Payload preview copy button fixed** — fallback to `execCommand` for HTTP localhost; shows "✓ Copied" confirmation
- **Auth clarification** — production credentials don't work with test API (separate OAuth servers); test credentials were retired when badge was issued; local dev uses preview only
- **Confirmed clean payloads**: motor vehicle extrication (FFD26-1819) and wildland fire (UEH26-0017)

### 2026-05-20 — Hub-and-Spoke Nav + NERIS Production + Admin Troubleshooting
- Sidebar trimmed to 6 top-level items: Dashboard, Operations, Personnel, Training, Equipment, Reports
- Dept Admin collapsed to single link → `/dept-admin` hub page with conditional tiles (ISO, NERIS, Public Site)
- New hub pages: `/operations`, `/reports`, `/iso` (sub-hub under Dept Admin)
- Enhanced existing pages as hubs: `/equipment` (section cards + apparatus grid), `/training` (Events/Certs/Print cards), `/personnel` (subtitle)
- `HubCard` component (`components/HubCard.tsx`) — shared card with stat badge + alert state
- `PageNavBar` component (`components/PageNavBar.tsx`) — auto Back + parent hub link on every page, pathname-driven
- NERIS V1 Compatible badge earned — passed FSRI compatibility check (2026-05-20)
- NERIS production credentials obtained from neris.fsri.org, set in Vercel + .env.local
- NERIS dept enrollment UI (`/dept-admin/neris`) rebuilt — full 4-step guide (NERIS account signup → entity ID → FireOps7 integration enrollment → connect), FireOps7 Client ID displayed with copy button, Test Connection button pings NERIS API
- `nerisCheckEntityExists()` added to `lib/neris-api.ts` — uses validate endpoint to confirm entity + auth
- `testNerisConnection()` server action added to `app/actions/departments.ts`
- NERIS admin troubleshooting panel (`/admin/neris`) — 3 tabs:
  - Departments: all NERIS-enabled depts, entity ID status, submitted/draft/error counts, last submission, per-dept Test button
  - Issues: failed submissions with raw error + ready-but-not-submitted drafts, direct link to NERIS form
  - Error Logs: system_logs filtered to NERIS with dept context
- `neris_last_error` column added to `incident_neris` — stores API error message on failed submissions
- Submit action: on failure writes `neris_status='error'` + `neris_last_error`; on success clears `neris_last_error`
- `NERIS_USE_TEST` still `true` — flip to `false` after confirming production credentials work

### 2026-05-17 — Training Module Overhaul + Fire School Polish
- Training member page: replaced 3-tab layout with unified My Training list + My Certifications section
- Simple cert flow: admin assigns cert with training date → member logs attendance after date → officer verifies → cert auto-issued → member signs
- Training events: added `certification_type_id` — verified attendance auto-issues cert to member
- Direct cert entry: admin UI built in Enrollments tab, `createDirectCertification` action (was action-only, no UI)
- Member signatures on all cert records (`member_certifications.signature_url`, `signed_at`)  
- `CertSignaturePadModal` component for cert signing
- Dept-wide enrollment: "Assign to All Active Members" toggle — one click creates enrollments for entire dept
- Re-enroll button on withdrawn enrollment rows
- Admin Pending tab: shows both pending course unit progress AND pending simple cert sessions
- Fuel log: inline edit for officer+ (Edit button per row, same form pre-filled)
- Fire school: on/off toggle in sys admin (system_settings table) — when off, QR codes show marketing cover page with inquiry form
- Fire school inquiry form: submits to system_logs as fire_school_inquiry type
- Salamander QR scanner: Take Photo fallback for dense QR codes

### 2026-05-16 — Fire School Realtime + Verification + QR Research
- Fire school settings page (`/fire-school/settings`) — timezone selector saved to localStorage per device, drives fill log timestamp display
- Fill log converted to Supabase Realtime — new fills appear instantly on tablet without reload, new rows flash green for 3s, pulsing Live badge in header
- Fill verification added — `verified_at` column on `fire_school_fill_logs`; Verify button on tablet fill log row; Verify button on fill station success screen for single-operator use
- Unverified fill prompt — scanning a bottle that has an unverified fill shows an amber banner with Verify/Skip before the normal fill flow
- QR scanner improvements — native BarcodeDetector API (Chrome/Android) as primary with jsQR fallback; Take Photo button uses native camera for full-res still decode (solves dense/proprietary QR codes)
- Salamander personnel accountability QR format decoded — binary payload with readable fields: LASTNAME*FIRSTNAME, dept name after ESC char, title, cert codes. Stored in `qr_debug_scans` for reference.
- Accountability module architecture documented in REFERENCE.md — full standalone PAR system with temp cards, planned for future build
- Kiosk/movement tracking concept documented in CLAUDE.md — deferred, build accountability first

### 2026-05-06 — Admin Hub + Unified Nav + ISO
- Equipment hub (`/dept-admin/setup`): wizard → plain tabs (Stations/Apparatus/Compartments/Items/Assets), Personnel tab removed
- Load button on each apparatus card → `/equipment/[id]?from=/dept-admin/setup`; back nav returns to hub
- Back button moved below header as styled action row button across ALL detail pages (equipment, stations, incidents, personnel, inspection run, new incident, new event)
- Personnel hub (`/dept-admin/personnel`): Members tab (card grid 1→2→3 cols) + Attendance Settings tab
- Training hub: updated to left rail + mobile scroll tabs, renamed "Training"
- Main nav unified — identical for all roles: Dashboard/Personnel/Training & Events/Operations/Inspections/Reports
- ISO removed from main nav; added to Dept Admin: Hose Inventory / Hydrants / ISO Report (3 separate links)
- Assets tab added to Equipment hub (5th tab): card grid using existing props + "Full Roster →" link
- `removeHose` + `removeHydrant` server actions added to `iso.ts`
- Hose/Hydrant pages: Add button moved below header, Remove button added per row (inline confirm/cancel)

### 2026-05-06 — Nav Redesign + Member Equipment + Back Navigation
- Nav restructured: Personnel / Training & Events / Operations / Inspections / ISO (officer+) / Reports
- Apparatus + Stations removed from main nav — accessed via Inspections drill-down
- My Profile: sidebar footer name links to own personnel profile page
- Inspections landing page rebuilt — stations group apparatus cards, compartments visible inline with View / Inspect / Daily Check per row
- Member equipment: `moveItemToCompartment` + `removeItemFromCompartment` opened to all dept members (was officer+)
- `CompartmentItemsClient` — Move modal (apparatus + compartment picker) + Remove confirm on compartment detail page
- `BackButton` component (`components/BackButton.tsx`) — accepts `href` for explicit dest or falls back to `router.back()`
- `?from` navigation pattern: InspectionsClient View links pass `?from=/inspections`; compartment page reads it and passes to BackButton
- Hardcoded back destinations: personnel → /personnel, stations → /stations, incidents → /incidents
- Compartment detail page: removed Verify Present + Start Inspection buttons (accessed via Inspections page); Back is now a styled action card button
- Docs split: CLAUDE.md / REFERENCE.md / MODULES.md / HISTORY.md (previous session)

### 2026-05-05 — Permit Flow, Login Polish, Equipment Nav
- Burn permit submission triggers `logEvent` → notify-on-log → sys admin email
- Sign-then-approve flow: officer must sign via `PermitSignatureModal` before status flips to approved
- Login page: show/hide password toggle (eye icon, tabIndex -1)
- Apparatus detail: "Manage Equipment" link → `/equipment/[id]` (officer+ only, when active compartments)
- `signature_pad` npm package installed (was missing from node_modules)
- CLAUDE.md trimmed to essentials; REFERENCE.md / MODULES.md / HISTORY.md split out

### 2026-05-05 — Burn Permit Signatures + Public Site Completion (earlier session)
- Config validation: yellow banner + server-side block if county/sheriff info missing
- Officer signs in inbox → `signatures/permits/officer/{id}.png`
- Resident signs/acknowledges at `/dept/[slug]/permit-status`
- Both signatures embedded on printed permit
- `ApplicantSignatureSection` — choose digital sign vs print-and-sign path

### 2026-05-04, session 2 — Public Site + Inbox + Burn Permit
- `/dept/[slug]/*` — landing, events, burn permit, records request
- Permit status + public print pages
- Sys admin Public Site config tab on `/admin/dept/[id]`
- Officer event public/private toggle from `/events` manage panel
- Public Inbox (`/inbox`) — burn permits + records requests tabs
- Printable Nebraska state burn permit (NE Statute 81-520.01 legal text)
- `send-permit-approval` Edge Function deployed (awaiting domain verification)
- `apparatus.exclude_from_iso` flag

### 2026-05-04, session 1 — Announcements + Training Signatures
- `/announcements` — newest-first, pinned float, officer create, admin pin/delete, all mark read
- Dashboard unread announcement banner
- `signature_pad` installed, `SignaturePadModal` built
- Training signatures: members sign own records, embedded on `/print/training-signin`

### 2026-05-03, session 2 — Setup Flow Polish + Permission Model
- Inspection Templates tab in Dept Setup
- HelpPrompt dismissable help system (localStorage persistence)
- Officer add personnel via `PersonnelAddForm` on `/personnel`
- Dashboard profile card (replaced 3 stat cards)
- Role-adaptive quick links on dashboard
- Nav: "Training" → "Certifications", Incidents → Operations group
- Permission model finalized: setup = admin only, operational pages = role-adaptive
